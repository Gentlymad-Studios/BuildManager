A complex build manager to help with creating and uploading builds to several plattforms with a versioning system.
Please be aware that this needs vendor specific files that are being excluded from this package (Steamworks upload client, GOG upload client) as we are not allowed to bundle those.
If you have the relevant files, this tool expects them to be in:

`<yourUnityProject>/BuildTools/<Steam or GOG>/Builder`

~ Use at your own risk ~
